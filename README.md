Overview:
This program demonstrates functional programming operations on multi-dimensional vectors in C++ using templates. It implements operations like map, filter, reduce, and zip, allowing users to manipulate vectors with user-defined functions.

How to Run:

Run the program from the main function.

Functionalities:

Initialization (initVec):
Initializes a 2D vector using a single 1D vector.


Printing (printVec and printElem):
Prints vectors in a readable format.

Zipping (zip):
Combines two vectors by interleaving their elements.

Generate (generate):
Creates a new vector by applying a function to generate values based on indices.


Filter (filter):
Filters elements of a vector based on a condition.


Map (map):
Transforms elements of a vector using a function.


Reduce (reduce):
Combines all elements of a vector into a single value using a function.


Program Flow:

Integer Vector Operations:
Initializes vectors v and w.
Demonstrates zipping, generating, filtering, mapping, and reducing operations.

String Vector Operations:
Concatenates a vector of strings into a single string using the reduce function.

Character Vector Operations:
Combines characters from a vector into a single string using the reduce function.

Requirements:

A C++ compiler.


Limitations:
I could not print out the brackets properly.
My zip (z,z) was not duplicated properly.
